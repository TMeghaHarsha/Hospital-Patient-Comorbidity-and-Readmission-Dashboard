# Diabetic Patient Comorbidity & Readmission Dashboard

A Streamlit-based interactive analytics dashboard for exploring comorbidities, clustering patterns, and readmission risk among diabetic hospital patients. This project provides a complete end-to-end workflow — from data cleaning to advanced analytics and visual insights.

## Key Functionalities

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, caps outliers, standardizes numerical features, and prepares encoded categorical features.

- **Summary Statistics:** Descriptive statistics, distribution plots, pie charts, and data insights.

- **Feature Selection:** Correlation heatmaps, threshold-based selection, and downloadable selected feature sets.

- **Dimensionality Reduction:**
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  - Precomputed t-SNE visualization

- **Patient Clustering:** Compare multiple clustering algorithms:
  - K-Means
  - DBSCAN
  - Hierarchical Clustering  
  Includes t-SNE cluster overlays and silhouette-based comparisons.

- **Association Rule Mining:** Apriori-based disease association discovery with lift, confidence, and support metrics.

## Dashboard Workflow

- **Raw Data → Cleaning:**
  - Remove irrelevant columns
  - Standardize numerical features
  - Clip extreme values
  - Encode categorical variables

- **Analysis Layer:**
  - Statistics
  - Feature correlations
  - Principal components
  - Clustering
  - Association patterns

- **Visualization Layer:**
  - Interactive charts (Plotly), tables, metrics, and gradient-styled UI.

## Deployment

- The dashboard is publicly hosted on HuggingFace Spaces using the Streamlit template:
- **Live App:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/Megha-Harsha/Hospital-Patient-Comorbidity-and-Readmission-Dashboard
- Note: The app loads and processes a large dataset during startup. Please wait 10-12 minutes for the dashboard to fully initialize.
